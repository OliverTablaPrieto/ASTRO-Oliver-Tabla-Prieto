        <p>Hi there, I'm Alex. I build my own products, along side working with some amazing companies to help them build theirs.
Most recently, I was working with MoonPay to help build the future of payments. Before that, I was working with Monzo - the fastest growing bank in the UK. Originally joining as a product designer, I transitioned into a web engineer role where I worked with a variety of teams to help rethink modern day banking for their millions of customers.
I also worked with Kalo (which eventually became Polywork) where I was the first UI Engineering hire. My responsibilities included building out the design system as well as ensuring a high bar of design quality across the product.
I've always bounced somewhere between design and engineering, however the common thread has always been my love for building things that people love to use.
If you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me here: hey@alexpate.com.</p>
